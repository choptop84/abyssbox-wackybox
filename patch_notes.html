            <li>Added Overlays, now your themes can have things overlaying the entire screen! This feature is best shown off in 'I am on fire!' and '2012 video tutorial'.</li>
            <p></p>
			<li>Added Titles, Now your theme can have it's own custom title in the description. A few themes use this, 'I am on fire', 'Half-Life' and 'Half-Life: Source' use this feature.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>We've also added a new preset called Nokia Ringtone.</li>

<ul>
            <p></p>
            <li>Added Shortcut buttons! These buttons do things that are only accessable in the edit menu and via keyboard shortcuts, but with the added bonus of working on Mobile too! This will undoubtably help with a lot of the issues that plauge AbyssBox Mobile. I'm hoping there will also be future things that improve Mobile.</li>
            <p></p>
			<li>Added a new Layout. Theatre! This layout is a fullscreen layout that allows you to view all the notes without the distractions of the Track Editor and The settings being there!</li>
            <p></p>

</h3><h2>Version 1.0 - The Full Release</h2>
	<h3> <ul>
	<p>This update is the biggest one yet! Adding several new features to AbyssBox. Starting with,</p>
		<ul>
        </ul>
		<p></p> 
		<ul>
		</ul>
        <li>The Custom Theme Editor!</li>
        <ul>
        <p></p>
        	<li>All of your custom theme needs in one place! Making your 
own themes couldn't be easier! Just go to the Custom Theme prompt in 
Prefrences and check it out yourself!</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Thanks again to LeoV for helping so much on making the custom theme editor, without him this feature wouldn't of ever released!</li>
		</ul>
        <p></p>
        <li>Thanks to the Custom Theme Editor, we now have three new Colorblind Assistence themes! These themes are called: </li>
        <ul>
        <p></p>
			<li>Deuteranopia</li>
        	<li>Protanopia</li>
            <li>Tritanopia</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Deuteranopia was made by Neptendo, while I made the other two.</li>
		</ul>
        <p></p>
        <li>Speaking of themes, We've actually added 3 new ones outside of colorblind themes, adding to a total of 6 new themes!</li>
        <ul>
        <p></p>
			<li>New Theme: Half-life. This theme has a similar color scheme and appearance to the original Half-Life.</li>
            <p></p>
        	<li>New Theme: Doom 1993. This theme features a redlit sky and 
the original doom font used in the first doom game. Thanks to Neptendo 
for adding the Doom Styled AbyssBox logo!</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>New Theme: Windows Xp, simulate the asthetic of the 
classic interface of Windows Xp, complete with the original font, mouse,
 and wallpapaer in the background. This theme also features unique 
buttons similar to how Windows Xp looked Back then. We even have a 
Windows Xp-esque logo replacing the abyssbox logo!</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>AbyssBox Classic has also been updated to feature new editor background sprites.</li>
		</ul>
        <p></p>
                <li>We're not done just yet!</li>
        <ul>
        <p></p>
			<li>The layouts featured in update 0.9 have been updated, kind of?</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>The layouts themselves haven't recieved any updates, but
 the icons for them in the Layout Prompt has been fixed and now all of 
them are the same size regardless of theme.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>We've also added two new presets for you to try out. Harmonic Piano, and Organic Synth.</li>
            <p></p>
		</ul>
        </ul>
        
<p>That was quite a bit this time!</p>

	<p>1/15/2024</p>

</h3><h2>Version o.9.2</h2>
	<h3> <ul>
	<li>This update added only one change, but it's quite a big one!</li>
		<ul>
        </ul> 
		<ul>
        <li>Supersaw is now in AbyssBox!!! This BeepBox 9.0 Feature is 
quite lacking in most beepbox mods, and since now it's featured in 
AbyssBox, we can officially use Samples, Custom Chip, The OP FM, and 
Supersaw all in one package!</li>
        </ul>

<p>If you would like to make a suggestion for what AbyssBox should add, 
go ahead and ping @choptop84 on BeepCord in the #modded-beepbox channel!</p>

	<p>1/6/2024</p>

<h2>Version o.9</h2>
	<h3> <ul>
	<li>Added three new layouts!</li>
		<ul>
        <li>Flipped (AB), this layout reverses the Long Layout, currently unfinished but it'll work for now.</li>
		<li>Focus (AB), this layout reduces the size of the song settings by around 40%!</li>
        <li>Long (AB), This is an AbyssBox twist on the classic Long 
Layout, normally the track editor would go under the instrument and song
 settings, but now in this layout it actually does the opposite! The 
settings will now go over where track would normally go! Wanna try it 
out for yourself? Just make a song with over 75 Bars and swap between 
the two layouts!</li>
		</ul>
        </ul> 
        <ul><li>Updated AbyssBox Light</li>
		<ul>
        <li>Before, the AbyssBox Light was a little hard to see thanks 
to it's low contrast, now the contrast has been bumped up thanks to the 
suggestion that Nintari made. She suggested that I increase the contrast
 of the theme just a little bit and now it looks way better!</li>
        </ul>
        </ul> 
		<ul><li>Added two new fonts! AbyssType and AbyssType Small, they're in the testing phase, so expect major changes!</li>
       	</ul>
		<ul><li>The custom cursor for The three AbyssBox original themes now work!</li>
        </ul>
		<p>All changes now are available in AbyssBox 0.9! If you aren't seeing
 these changes being reflected in your version of AbyssBox, then I would
 suggest clearing your cookies, fair warning though. Your settings will 
be reset!</p>
